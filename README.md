# IOI-task archive

So I was thinking about downloading all materials related with previous IOI-tasks, so problems, solutions, tests etc.
In the directory /IOI-tasks of this repository you shall find all tasks with solutions (if found) as downloaded from [https://ioinformatics.org/](https://ioinformatics.org/)
Until this time there exist only from 1989 until 2018. For future downloads I created get_me.py

## Download desired years
The get_me.py python script let's you download a specified year range for the tasks
```
Usage: ./get_me.py [from_year] [to_year] [path_to_save] 
```
If you just want to download everything
```
Usage:  ./get_me.py [path_to_save]
```
